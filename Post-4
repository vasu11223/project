<p>The move comes at a time when the crypto market is teetering from the collapse of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gadgets360.com/tags/ftx">FTX</a>, which is seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States.</p>

<p>The unraveling of one of the biggest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gadgets360.com/tags/crptocurrency">crypto</a>&nbsp;exchanges in the world has also fanned worries around the industry's continued ability to draw investments from venture capital and private equity giants.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.gadgets360.com/tags/binance">Binance</a>&nbsp;said it intends to ramp up its commitment amount to $2 billion (nearly Rs. 16,340 crore) in the near future depending on need.</p>

<p>"We anticipate this initiative will last about six months and will be flexible on the investment structure —&nbsp;token, fiat, equity, convertible instruments, debt, credit lines, etc," the crypto exchange added in a statement.</p>

<p>It was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gadgets360.com/cryptocurrency/news/ftx-collapse-us-congress-investigate-binance-changpeng-zhao-role-3532143">reported</a>&nbsp;a few days back that&nbsp;Binance is also under global regulatory scrutiny following the sudden collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange and its subsidiaries. While speaking to reporters, Republican Patrick McHenry, a senior House Republican, confirmed that Binance's role in the FTX collapse is under congressional scrutiny.
